# git_training

A repository for training mathematicians on how to use Git.

This was inspired by the ICERM semester on Nonlinear Algebra in Fall 2018, and used again in Fall 2019 at Illustrating Mathematics

## Schedule

* Session 1 -- Intro to git
* Session 2 -- Github basics
* Session 3 -- Branching and merging
* Session 4 -- Gihub, forking, issues, pull requests

## Notes

The presentation in this repo is not a reference material. It is intended only for use as a presentation aid during a training session.  There is a lot which will go on via a projector and live demos.
